# TheMinimalToDo
A work in progress Python todo list in Flask

Still need to work out how to remove a completed task from the 'To Do' list and add it to the 'completed' list, while maintaining the formating.

Implement UUID to id each task, in order to add them to a SQL database. 
Moving from 'to do' to 'complete' has been 'completed' haha
